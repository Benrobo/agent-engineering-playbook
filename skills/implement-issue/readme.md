# implement-issue

Implement a scoped issue from its acceptance criteria and repository context. Use when a ticket or concrete bug is assigned for implementation.

## Requirements

Issue tracker or pasted issue; repository and local development commands. A tracker integration is optional. No provider credentials belong in this folder. Configure connectors or CLIs through your coding agent's normal setup. If an integration is unavailable, use supplied evidence or return a local draft with the limitation stated.

## Set up with your coding agent

1. Copy this complete folder into `.agents/skills/implement-issue/` for Codex, or `.claude/skills/implement-issue/` for Claude Code. Compare and merge if a folder already exists.
2. Populate `project-context.md` using verified project facts. Keep `SKILL.md` and that file together.
3. Invoke `$implement-issue` in Codex or `/implement-issue` in Claude Code. For other agents, consult their skill support; when unavailable, attach both Markdown files and explicitly ask the agent to follow them for the task.
4. Keep project-wide policy in your existing project instruction file. Add a short pointer to this skill when useful instead of copying its entire procedure there.

## Adapt to your project

Configure: **issue source; package ownership; architecture entry points; validation commands; branch conventions**. Replace framework or workflow choices only when your repository supports the replacement. Preserve the procedure's evidence requirements and scope boundaries. Remove steps that truly do not apply rather than inventing infrastructure to satisfy them.

Ask your agent: “Inspect my repository and propose project-specific edits to this skill and its context worksheet. Cite the files that establish each command and convention. Do not run deployments or modify external systems.” Review that proposed adaptation before adopting it.

## Trial request

> Implement this issue: a failed save must preserve the form values. First trace the existing flow, then fix and verify it.

Expected behavior: A fix that preserves input on failure, a relevant regression check, and no unrelated form rewrite.

Try this on an isolated branch or synthetic evidence first. Check actual artifacts and tool results, not just the agent's summary. If it fails, change the narrow instruction responsible and rerun the same scenario. Structural validity alone does not prove behavioral quality.
